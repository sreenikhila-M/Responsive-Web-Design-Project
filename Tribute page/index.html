        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Vujicic" target="_blank"> NICK VUJICIC </a> was born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1982 to Dušanka and Borislav Vujičić, Serbian immigrants from Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>He was born without fully formed limbs. According to his autobiography, his mother refused to see him or hold him when the nurse held him in front of her, and she and her husband went out of the hospital and vomited from seeing their son with no limbs, but they eventually accepted the condition and understood it as &quot;God&#39;s plan for their son.&quot;</p>

<p>Originally, the toes of one of his feet were fused. An operation was performed to separate the toes so that he could use them as fingers to grab. He refers to it as his chicken drumstick.</p>
          
<p>After his mother showed him a newspaper article about a woman praying with a severe disability when he was seventeen, he started to give talks at his prayer group. [9] Vujicic graduated from Griffith University at the age of 21 with a Bachelor of Commerce degree, with a double major in accountancy and financial planning.</p>

<p>In 2005, Vujicic founded Life Without Limbs, an international non-profit organisation and ministry. In 2007, he founded Attitude is Altitude, a secular motivational speaking company.[citation needed]starred in the short film The Butterfly Circus. At the 2010 Method Fest Independent Film Festival, he was awarded Best Actor in a Short Film for his starring performance as Will.</p>
